Hi [Stakeholder's name],

Hope your day is going well!

As requested, I have done an initial assessment of the Fetch rewards data, specifically looking into
users, brands, and receipts.

I used python to analyze the data since the files provided were zipped .json files.
I did run into an issue where I was unable to unzip and use those .json files and had to convert them 
to csv so my findings are based on the converted csv files which are attached. 

Depending on how often this data will need to be ingested and how large the data loads are anticipated to 
be, it could cause issues moving into production. Runtime extending into the next run or runs failing
due to how much data is being called are potential issues.
There are work-arounds we can do: breaking up data by limiting how much we bring in each pull and 
by figuring out a schedule that works best for this data. 

In addition, there are a few questions I have/observations about the data and wanted to see if you have 
any insight into why from a business standpoint.

 -- How is this data being accessed? And are these all the fields that can be provided or 
 can more be requested? This would help in understanding the data more and to see if 
 it can explain any issues I came across.
 -- There are around 300 null receipt ids, what is usually the cause of this?
 -- There are few records where purchase date is after finished date, what is usually the cause of this?
 Are users able to edit after submitting? 
 -- Not all brands are unique, is this something we should deduplicate in our models?

I know there is a lot in this email, I would be glad to set up some time to go over the data in more detail!

Best,
Gautami
